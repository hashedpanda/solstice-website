# Solstice

This is the website for Solstice, a fictional country on the bits & Bytes Minecraft server.

## Development.

You first need to ensure you have [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation) instead.

Then, install dependencies:
```
pnpm i
```

Start a dev server to see the result of changes as you make them:
```
pnpm dev
```

Build the site for deployment:
```
pnpm build
```

## Resources

This site uses Astro, so you will probably find its [docs](https://astro.build) useful.

## Contributing

Go talk to Ashe first. Write meaningful commit names, and follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) spec.
