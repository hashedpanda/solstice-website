Solstan citizenship grants you the right to live and work in Solstice, to participate in our democracy, and to receive a Solstan passport.

## Obtaining citizenship

There are three ways to obtain citizenship:

### Birth

You will automatically receive citizenship if, at birth, at least one of your parents have it.

### Naturalization

You may be naturalized if you fulfill the following requirements:

- You have played on the bits & Bytes server within the last 30 days.
- You are not deemed a threat to national security.
- You are not deemed likely to break Solstan law should you become a citizen.
- You are not a citizen of a nation that is considered an enemy of Solstice, except if you're seeking asylum.

You may contact Minister of the Interior Ashe in order to apply for citizenship.

### Reclaimation

If you were a citizen of one of the following, you were automatically granted citizenship upon the ratification of the Fourth Federal Constitution:
	- People's Democratic Republic of Solstice
	- Dozhdan Republic
	- Purple Inc.
	- Republic of Bohemia
	- Republic of Firefly
	- Republic of Othoroot

## Asylum

If you are under undue threat or danger within your home country, and unable to safely reside in another country, you may seek citizenship on the basis of asylum.

Seeking asylum does not free you from any of the requirements associated with naturalization unless otherwise specified, but it does mean that your application may be expedited if it's necessary for your own safety.
