Solstice is a federation. This means that it is split into two levels, federal and provincial.

## Federal

Federal elections happen at least once every 90 days. They are triggered when the Prime Minister dissolves the Federal Parliament, and occur 3 days later.

All Solstan citizens can vote in federal elections. Anyone can run for election to the Federal Parliament. Candidates must run under political parties.

In the election, each voter can vote for 1 political party. Each vote grants 1 seat in the Federal Parliament, and the total number of seats is equal to the total number of votes, ensuring perfectly proportional representation.

If you are registered to be pinged, you will be notified when an election occurs. You may contact Minister of the Interior Ashe to be registered.

**Note:** For the purpose of roleplay, each political party does not need to have more than 1 person associated with it, who will then control all of the party's seats.
