**Minister:** Ashe

The Ministry of Transportation is responsible for managing larger transportation projects across Solstice in cooperation with the provinces.

While the provinces ultimately have the right to decide which projects get built within them, and they may choose to take full responsibility for projects within their own borders, it is useful to be able to coordinate on a larger scale, such as with long-distance rail, or freeways.

## Federal Road Authority

The Federal Road Authority, or FRA for short, manages larger road projects within Solstice. It is responsible the Solstan federal highway network.

The FRA is headed by Raina.
